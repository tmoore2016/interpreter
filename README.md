# Doorkey, a Monkey Derivative by Travis Moore

## Doorkey is a tested interpreter written in the Go language, <https://golang.org/>

## Developed by following "Writing an Interpreter in Go" by Thorsten Ball, <https://interpreterbook.com/>

Motivation: I am learning to program. I want to get better.

Currently working on:

~~Chapter 1: Lexing~~

~~Chapter 2: Parsing~~

~~Chapter 3: Evaluation~~

~~Chapter 4: Extending the Interpreter~~

The book is completed, but not the journey. There are countless improvements that can be made to Doorkey. Some are challenges within the book, others occurred to me as I went along. Currently, this project follows the book very closely. Generally every time I went off script, I broke things and had to revert.

Thorsten Ball, the author of **Writing an Interpreter in Go** has released a "Lost Chapter" that contains information for creating a macro system within the interpreter. There is also a sequel now, **Writing a Compiler in Go** that is scarily enticing.

The stated motivation for this project was to become better at programming. I can say I've improved, but I can't call myself a programmer yet.
